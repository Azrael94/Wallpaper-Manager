# Wallpaper Manager for Android
-----

A simple little app that pulls a JSON file from a url of your choice and lets you apply them or save them to your sdcard.

# Usage
-----
- To configure this application, check the [Config](https://github.com/Bencodes/Wallpaper-Manager/blob/master/res/values/config.xml) and customize it. Be sure to change the folder and the manifest URL to represent your unique information.

- An example of the JSON file can be found in the folder. [Assets](https://raw.github.com/Bencodes/Wallpaper-Manager/master/assets/demo-manifest.json)

- Note, this application is based on ActionBarSherlock so you will need to add that into your workspace.
